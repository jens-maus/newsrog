NewsRog 1.8+ is hereby released as free software under the GNU General Public
License. Please read this license (COPYING) and make sure you understand
the terms and conditions of this license which defines under with conditions
you are allowed to use and/or modify the sources of NewsRog.

NewsRog has been previously compiled with SAS/C 6.58. However, the current set
of sources and includes does *not* compile out-of-the-box with either SAS/C or
any other C compiler. Therefore some initial work is required to port the
source properly to be compilable with gcc - which is considered as the
future compiler for any further version of NewsRog. That's why the old
"smakefile" files are still provided with the current CVS checkin.

So please, if you are willing to volunteer in porting the sources to gcc,
drop the current NewsRog Open Source Team a short mail and we will add you
to the main developer list of NewsRog and grant you write access to the CVS
repository. However, please make yourself familiar with the current sources
and also with the included SDI_#? headers which should be probably used during
the process of porting the sources to gcc and also to other platforms like
AmigaOS4 and/or MorphOS.

If you want to develop this program further, please register with SourceForge.net
and notify one of the project admins. Until a real homepage is created, please
consider http://sourceforge.net/projects/newsrog/ as our homepage.

NewsRog 1.8+ is hereby released as free software under the GNU Lesser
General Public License. Please read this license (COPYING) and make sure
you understand the terms and conditions of this license which defines
under which conditions you are allowed to use and/or modify the sources
of NewsRog.

NewsRog has been previously compiled with SAS/C 6.58. However, the current
set of sources and includes does *NOT* compile out-of-the-box, neither
with SAS/C or any other C compiler. Therefore, some initial effort is
required to port the source properly to be compilable with gcc, which is
considered as the future compiler for any further version of NewsRog.
That's why the old SAS/C makefiles were provided as part of the initial
CVS checkin.

If you want to help in porting the sources to gcc or contribute to the
project in any way, please drop us a mail. Programmers should first
familiarise themselves with the current sources and also with the
included SDI_#? headers, which should probably be used while porting
the sources to gcc and eventually to other platforms like AmigaOS 4
and/or MorphOS.

Becoming a NR developer also requires that you first register with
SourceForge.net to get an username.

<TD>

NewsRog is, quite simply, the most powerful usenet news reading software
available for the Amiga.  Nothing else comes close.  Even most PC
usenet applications do not approach the power and performance of NewsRog.
<P>

Other newsreaders, if they provide such features at all, offer only
limited abilities for customizing how articles are selected, killed, and
displayed.  NewsRog goes much further, letting you completely customize
your environment in ways most other newsreaders cannot dream of.

<TD ALIGN=Center VALIGN=Top BGCOLOR=#777799><FONT SIZE=+2> Why was it created? <FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

Quite simply, no other newsreader available for the Amiga provided the
features power users desire.  We believe that once you try NewsRog, you'll
never go back!

<TD ALIGN=Center VALIGN=Top BGCOLOR=#777799><FONT SIZE=+2> What can it do? <FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

NewsRog provides a huge number of features:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>On and offline reading and posting.<P></LI>

  <LI>Asynchronous design.  You can start browsing articles even before
      the headers are finished loading.  You can read articles in one
      group while batch downloading another group for later offline
      reading.<P></LI>

  <LI>Multiple server support.  You can get some groups from a different
      newsserver than other groups.<P></LI>

  <LI>Article prefetching can load the next few articles while you
      read the first, to avoid the network lag of fetching the following
      articles.<P></LI>

  <LI>Full support for inline 16 and 24 bit truecolor images on supporting
      CyberGfx screen modes.<P></LI>

  <LI>"Single key" group reading, thread smart.<P></LI>

  <LI>Full clipboard support.<P></LI>

  <LI>Full dynamic searching - search results are updated instantly
      after each keystroke!  You can search through article bodies or
      any header field.<P></LI>

  <LI>Full control over article display.  Plug-ins are available to
      fully control how articles are displayed, including different fonts
      and colors.  A few of the many features are: Smart colorization of
      quoted text, trimming unnecessarily large blocks of quoted text,
      hiding signature blocks, colorization of header fields, trimming of
      large empty regions in an article, clickable URL's (interfaces with
      most web browsers), ROT13, inline display of binary images, and
      more.  Toggle between hidden and displayed text, or control
      interfaces for things such as uuencoded data imbedded in
      articles.<P></LI>

  <LI>Newsgroup subsetting and user defined views.  Create a selection
      filter to toggle between the "FS:" or the "WTB:" posts in a
      marketplace group with a mouseclick.  Create another to show all
      articles in any thread that you have posted to.<P></LI>

  <LI>Kill threads now, and in the future!  If you don't wish to read a
      thread, you can have NewsRog kill all future posts to that thread
      automatically so you don't have to re-kill the thread every time
      new articles are posted to it.<P></LI>

  <LI>Fully indented threading capability.  Among the fastest threading of
      any newsreader on any platform.<P></LI>

  <LI>Incredibly powerful article selection and kill capabilities.  Most
      newsreaders limit you to performing pattern matches on header
      fields, but not NewsRog.  You can, for example, define a filter that
      matches any article that is a <I>followup</I> to an article posted
      by particular author, for example.  Few (if any!) other newsreaders
      on any platform provide as much kill/select filter power.<P></LI>

  <LI>Plug-in artchitecture to support future display, selection, and kill
      capabilities.<P></LI>

  <LI>Sorting articles, groups, etc. by any criteria.<P></LI>

  <LI>Full understanding of posting dates normalized by time zone.<P></LI>

  <LI>Full control over displayed fields in lists.<P></LI>

  <LI>Local caching of headers so they don't have to be re-read from
      the network later.<P></LI>

  <LI>Near instantaneous startup of most groups.  No more long waits for
      headers to load.<P></LI>

  <LI>Fully abortable networking IO.  Opened a huge group or started to read
      a 5000 line post by mistake?  Just cancel it and keep going.<P></LI>

  <LI>Stateless performance.  Read some articles, take your machine
      offline, come back online later, maybe change to a different news
      server, and keep reading as if nothing happened.<P></LI>

  <LI>Network status & statistics Windows.  Network status & statistics
      windows.  Track average connection speeds, # of succeeded and failed
      connections to news servers, etc.  Automatically retry connections
      if they fail.<P></LI>

  <LI>Extremely high performance custom string handling for killing articles
      based on header fields.<P></LI>

  <LI>Smart text reflow filter.  Can fix "bad" rewraping done by other
      news software - for example,
<PRE>> Some quoted text lines are wrapped
badly
> by other software, but NewsRog can
fix
> them before displaying the article text.
</PRE><P></LI>

  <LI>Incremental article display.  The first part of an article is
  displayed even while the rest loads, so you can start reading before
  waiting for an entire 500 line article to load over your modem.<P></LI>

  <LI>User definable multimedia types and actions.<P></LI>

  <LI>Other features too numerous to mention.<P></LI>
</UL>

And that just scratches the surface!

<TD ALIGN=Center VALIGN=Top BGCOLOR=#777799><FONT SIZE=+2>How does NewsRog work? <FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

Here are some of the technical features of NewsRog:<P>

<UL>
     <LI>NewsRog is multithreaded.  Objects that perform time consuming
         operations can launch their own task.<P></LI>

     <LI>NewsRog uses runtime-binding.  This is a powerful method for
         allowing extensions to the program later on, by anyone, without
         even recompiling the software.<P></LI>

     <LI>NewsRog uses the
         <A HREF="http://www.sasg.com/"> MUI </A> object library.
         MUI is by far the most powerful object library available for the
         Amiga.<P></LI>

     <LI>NewsRog uses dynamic loading.  Only the features you use get
         loaded, to save memory.<P></LI>

     <LI>Every part of NewsRog is localizable using standard AmigaOS
         message catalogs.<P></LI>

     <LI>NewsRog uses custom written, extremely high performance string
         functions for article killing and selecting based on header
         fields.  These functions are up to 15 times faster than the
         compiler's built in string handling.  Few other newsreaders can
         touch NewsRog's speed for matching header fields against fixed
         strings.<P></LI>
          
</UL>

No.  There's much more.  Read on to discover it.

NewsRog maintains a list of subscribed groups.  This is a subset of the
entire list of groups available from the news server.  There might
potentially be tens of thousands of news groups available, and the chances
are that you are only interested in perhaps 10 or 20 of them.  All group
management is done from the Group List window.  Since NewsRog tracks a
great deal of information about groups, it would take too much space to
put all the groups from the server in the subscribed list, not to mention
that searching for the group you want in a list of 25,000 would quickly
lose its novelty.<P>

The default project includes a basic set of newsgroups, but you can add
more to build your own customized list.  There are several ways to
subscribe to newsgroups:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> If you have previously been using <I>tin</I> or another newsreader
       that supports .newsrc files, you can import your old groups by
       using the <B>Groups/Import&nbsp;.newsrc</B> menu item from the
       newsgroups list window.  This will tell NewsRog to subscribe to all
       the groups that were found in that file.<P></LI>

  <LI> If you know the exact name of the groups you wish to subscribe to,
       you can press the <B>Add&nbsp;Group</B> button and type the group
       name into the string gadget.<P>
       <CENTER>
       <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-Read-Add.GIF" WIDTH=393 HEIGHT=23>
       </CENTER><P>
       </LI>

  <LI> If you wish to search for newsgroups, you can have NewsRog display
       a list of all groups on the server, or all groups matching a
       particular pattern.  Pressing the <B>Show&nbsp;Groups</B> button
       will bring up a window that looks like this:<P>

       <CENTER>
       <IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-SGList.GIF" WIDTH=308 HEIGHT=259>
       </CENTER><P>

       Type in a pattern and pressing the <B>Fetch</B> key will retrieve
       groups from the server matching that pattern.  This pattern is
       parsed on the server and does not support the full set of features
       provided by AmigaOS patterns, but an asterisk wildcard may be used.<P>

Deleting Subscribed Groups
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

To unsubscribe from groups, select the groups you wish to unsubscribe from
in the group list and press the <B>Delete</B> button.  If you have
previously read some of these groups and NewsRog has cached the group
headers on your local disk, you will see a prompt like this:<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-DelOV.GIF" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=105>
</CENTER><P>

There are several choices available:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>Delete&nbsp;OV</B> - This will delete the overview (local disk
          cache) for the group when the group is deleted.  Any information
          about read and unread articles, cached articles, and so on will
          be lost.<P></LI>
  <LI> <B>Keep&nbsp;OV</B> - This will preserve the overview for the
          groups, although the group will be deleted from this project.
          This way, you may later add this group to this or another
          project and the overview information will still be present.<P></LI>
  <LI> <B>Cancel</B> - This will abort the operation and will not delete
          any groups.<P></LI>
  <LI> <B>Ask&nbsp;for&nbsp;Each</B>  - This will prompt ask whether to
          delete or keep the overview for each group in the list to be
          deleted.<P></LI>

The Group Window
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

Once you have chosen a group to read from your list of subscribed groups,
you can enter the group and start reading articles.  You can do this in
several ways:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Double click on one of the group names.</LI>
  <LI> Press return when one of the group names is selected.</LI>
  <LI> Press the <B>Read</B> button when one of the group names is selected.</LI>
</UL><P>

The group reader window for that group will then be opened.  As many group
windows may be opened at once as you wish, but the screen tends to become
cluttered with more than one or two, so it is best to close them when you
are done reading a group.  The group window looks like this:<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-GRead.GIF" WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=369>
</CENTER><P>

This version has been deliberately resized to be small enough to fit in
this documentation; in general it works best in a larger size (or smaller
fonts, which you can set in MUI preferences).  Most of the features of the
group window will be explained later in this documentation, but enough
basics to read articles are given here.<P>

You can see that the group window has two main areas.  On top is the
article list, and on the bottom is the article display (also known as the
"Article View").  The size of each can be adjusted by grabbing the balance
bar between them and dragging up or down.  Each of these areas will be
discussed in the next few sections.<P>

<A NAME="ArtList"></A>

The Article List
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

The article list has three different modes:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-3Art.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>
     <B>All Articles</B> - In this mode, all articles in all threads are
      displayed (as long as they match other filter criteria, but that
      will be explained in a more advances section).  For example, this
      mode might display:
<PRE>
  Lines  Grp  Auth        Repl  Subject
     21    1  Joe Cool    2     Some Subject
     85    1  Joe's Bro   0       Some Subject
     12    1  Piper       0       Some Subject
     40    2  Peter J.    1     Another Subject Entirely
     19    2  Frank Rama  0       Another Subject Entirely
</PRE>
  </LI>
       
  <LI><IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-2Art.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>
       <B>All Threads</B> - In All Threads mode, the article list displays
         only thread entry points.  A thread is a <I>basenote</I>, which
         is a original article, plus all its <I>followups</I>, which are
         replies to that article or to other followups.  In this mode, the
         above articles would look like this:
<PRE>
  Lines  Grp  Auth        Repl  Subject
     21    1  Joe Cool    2     Some Subject
     40    2  Peter J.    1     Another Subject Entirely
</PRE>
</LI>
       
  <LI><IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-1Art.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>
       <B>One Thread</B> - In One Thread mode, the article list displays
         only posts that are part of a particular chosen thread.  For
         example, if the first thread titled <I>Some Subject</I> is
         chosen, the list will display:
<PRE>
  Lines  Grp  Auth        Repl  Subject
     21    1  Joe Cool    2     Some Subject
     85    1  Joe's Bro   0       Some Subject
     12    1  Piper       0       Some Subject
</PRE>
</UL>

These modes can be thought of as levels of restriction: in the first, all
articles are displayed.  In the second, only thread entry points are
displayed, and in the third, only articles in a single thread.<P>

To view a particular article, you must be in either <B>All Articles</B>
mode or in <B>One Thread</B> mode.  Double clicking on the list in either
of those modes will fetch the requested article and display it in the
article view.  Double clicking in <B>All Threads</B> mode will display the
articles in the given thread by switching to <B>One Thread</B> mode.
You may also press the return key with an entry selected.<P>

To move back "up" to a higher mode, you may either press the button that
cycles between these images:
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-3Art.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-2Art.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-1Art.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>
, or you may use the arrow buttons:
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-ArrowUp.GIF" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=14>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-ArrowDn.GIF" WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=14>
.<P>

Almost every button or gadget in NewsRog also has a keyboard equivalent;
look at the MUI help bubbles to see what the keyboard equivalent is.<P>

The Article View
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

After the article you have selected is fetched from the network (or local
cache if available), it is displayed in the lower section of the group
window, called the article view.  Other features of the article view will
be explained elsewhere in this documentation, but for now, the <B>browse</B>
buttons are of interest.  There are two browse buttons: forward
(<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-BrowseF.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>), and reverse
(<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-BrowseR.GIF" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18>).<P>

Pressing the forward browse button (or the period/full-stop ".") key
will page forward in the article displayed in the article list.  When the
end of the article is reached, the next article in the present thread will
be fetched and displayed.  When the end of the thread is reached, the
first article in the next thread will be displayed, and so on until the
end of the group.  Many times, it is possible to browse news using just
by pressing the "." key when you are ready to continue reading.  The
reverse browse button (mapped to the "," key) performs the same function
but in reverse.  It pages back in the present article, etc.<P>

Closing the Group

<TD>

To close a group, you can use the close gadget in the upper left corner of
the window, or the <B>Group&nbsp;Project/Close</B> menu item.  This action
will close the group window, saving the current set of headers to a local
disk cache so they don't have to be fetched from the network next time.<P>

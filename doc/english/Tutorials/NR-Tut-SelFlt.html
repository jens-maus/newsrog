What are Selection, Kill, and Highlight Filters?
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

Selection, kill, and highlight filters are used to select which articles
you wish to read (or not to read) when reading a group.  It's possible to
make these filters group specific, or to apply them to any subset of
groups, such as "*.binaries.*", or "comp.*".<P>

Selection, kill, and highlight filters all use the same type of filters
(as opposed to <A HREF="NR-Tut-DspFlt.html"><I>display filters</I></A>,
which are a different thing altogether).  Selection filters act upon
articles, returning a "yes" or "no" answer for whether a given article
matches a given filter.  For example, you might define a filter to match
all articles that are crossposted to more than 3 groups, or a filter to
match all articles that are in any thread you've posted to yourself.
It is also possible to combine filters using <I>and</I> and <I>or</I>
logic to form more complex queries.<P>

There are several main uses for selection filters:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><I>Subsetting</I> groups - This allows you to define different
  <U>views</U> for looking at any group or set of groups.  For example,
  you might define one view that shows you all the "for sale" articles in
  a marketplace newsgroup, and another that shows you all the "wanted to
  buy" posts, and yet a third that shows you articles you have posted and
  any followups to those articles.  Any of these filters can be toggled on
  or off to immediately change your view of the group.<P></LI>

  <LI><I>Killing</I> articles.  Kill filters are used to remove various
  postings permanently.  After articles are killed, you never see them
  again no matter how you chose to view the group's articles.  This is
  useful to remove "spam" type posts.  For example, it's extremely
  unlikely that any post containing "Make Money Fast" or "$$$$" in
  the title is worth reading.  You can define a kill filter to remove such
  posts.<P></LI>

  <LI><I>Highlighting</I> articles.  You might make certain articles stand
  out in the article list, as in this example, in which a filter matching
  subject lines containing <I>Steinway</I> or <I>Baldwin</I> has been
  defined:<P>
   <CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-HLight.GIF" WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0>
   </CENTER><BR><P>

  The <A HREF="NR-Tut-Group.html#AL_HLight"> group reader </A> tutorial
  has more information on highlight filters as well.
  </LI>
</UL>

Since selection, kill, and highlight filters are three uses of the same
types of filter, the general term <I>Selection Filter</I> is used in this
documentation to describe them.<P>

Proper use of selection filters can greatly increase the signal to noise
ratio of usenet.  NewsRog provides uncommonly powerful selection and kill
filter capabilities compared to almost any other newsreader on any
platform.<P>

This section of the documentation discusses general filter topics.
The specifics of each different type of filter are covered in the
<A HREF="../NR-Reference.html">reference section</A> of this
documentation.<P>

Filters can be defined within the context of a particular group, in which
case they apply <U>only</U> to that group, or they can be defined globally
to apply to groups matching any particular pattern (set in the <I>Group
Patt</I> area of the filter list).  Global filters are defined in the <A
HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#FltOpts">configuration editor</A> for NewsRog.
Group specific filters are defined from within the group reader window.
Generally, if a filter is to apply to more than one group (for example, to
<I>comp.*</I>) it is best to define it once in the <A
HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#FltOpts">configuration editor</A> instead of
duplicating the filter in each group.<P>

<TR>
<TD ALIGN=Center VALIGN=Top WIDTH=120 BGCOLOR=#777799><FONT SIZE=+2>
Adding and Deleting Filters
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

In each filter list there is an <B>Add</B> button that, when pressed, will
display a popup list of available filters.  Filters are <I>plug-ins</I>,
so the list may change depending on which filters are currently
installed.  The popup filter list looks like this:<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-SelFlt-FAdd.GIF" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=172 BORDER=0>
</CENTER><P>

A filter may be added by double clicking on it's name in the popup list,
or multi-selecting several filters and pressing the <B>Insert Selected</B>
button.  The list may be closed without adding a filter by clicking the
<B>Add</B> button again or pressing the <B>Close</B> button in the popup
list.  You may add multiple filters at once by drag-selecting several and
clicking the <B>Insert Selected</B> button.  Note that you are not limited
to one instance of each type of filter.  You might, for example, add
several <I>Header Match</I> filters for different purposes.<P>

Removing filters is a simple matter of selecting those to be removed and
using the <B>Delete</B> button.<P>

<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-Cfg-SelFlt.GIF" WIDTH=437 HEIGHT=321 BORDER=0>

Multiple selection filters defined in a filter list may be combined in
either <I>Any</I> mode or <I>All</I> mode (which is another way of saying
<I>Or</I> and <I>And</I> in boolean logic).<P>

The lower right corner of the selection filter lists, such as the one seen
above, contains a gadget which can be set to:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Any</B> - An article will be matched if it is matched by
  <B>any</B> filter in the list.<P>

  <LI><B>All</B> - An article will only be matched if it is matched by
  <B>all</B> of the filters in the list.<P>
</UL>

If there is only one filter in the list, the behavior of both options
is identical.  If there is more than one, you can chose how they are
to be combined.  You may also create composite filters using any
boolean logic by using the
<A HREF="../Reference/NR-Ref-AndOr.html">And/Or</A> filter.<P>

Editing Filters

<TD>

Each filter provides a user interface for customizing its operation.  For
example, a crosspost limiting filter might allow you to edit the maximum
and minimum number of crossposts allowed in any article it matches.  A
header match filter might allow you to edit a list of patterns to be
contained in the headers of articles it matches.<P>

The user interface for any filter may be called up by either double
clicking on the name of the filter in the filter list, or by using the
<B>Edit</B> button.  The user interface for each filter is described in
detail in the <A HREF="../NR-Reference.html">reference section</A> of this
documentation.<P>

Certain information is available in every type of selection filter.
Calling up the editor for a particular filter reveals four main click
tabs:<P>

   <A HREF="../NR-Reference.html">reference section</A> of this
   documentation. <P></LI>

   <LI><A HREF="#GlobInfo"><B>Global Info</B></A> - This area edits data

   <LI><A HREF="#AuthNote"><B>Author Note</B></A> - This area can be used
   to edit a longer description for this filter, useful for complex
   filters that you wish to share with other people.  For instance, in
   an anti-spam filter you might describe its use and the type of spam it
   filters.<P></LI>

   <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-SelFlt-GlobInfo.GIF" WIDTH=421 HEIGHT=163
        BORDER=0>
   </CENTER><P>

The following features are available here:

<UL>
  <LI>The filter <B>Description</B> is any short string that will remind
      you of the purpose of this filter.  Filters can be toggled on and
      off individually to change your view of a particular group, and this
      name can serve to remind you what a particular filter does.<P></LI>

  <LI>The <B>Thread Mode</B>All selection filters have an option to control their
    behavior when used to limit the set of articles shown in the article
    list.  The setting only affects the behavior of
    the filter when the article list is set to show thread entry points
    only.  In this case, there are several modes to pick from:<P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>Base - </B>A thread is shown only if the basenote of the
        thread matches the filter.  This was the behavior of earlier
        verions of NewsRog.<P></LI>

        <LI><B>Any - </B>A thread is shown if any article in the thread
        matches the filter.<P></LI>

        <LI><B>All - </B>A thread is shown only if all articles in the
        thread matches the filter.</LI>
       </UL><P>

     Using this setting allows an easy way to create, for example, a
     filter which shows new articles, and shows threads which contain any
     new articles if the article list is in Threads mode.  This setting
     does not affect other uses such as kill or highlight filters.<P></LI>

  <LI>The <B>Expire Date</B>, if turned on, is a specific date on which
      this filter will expire and be deleted.  This is handy for creating
      filters that last a certain fixed period of time (say, one month)
      and then disappear.<P></LI>

  <LI>The <B>Expire Disuse</B> setting is similar, but will expire filters
       that have not matched anything in a certain period of time.  For
       example, let's say you create a filter to kill all posts to a certain
       thread.  When people stop posting to this thread after some days, weeks
       or months, it would be annoying to have to manually track and delete
       the kill filter for that thread.  But with NewsRog, you can have this
       happen automatically.  By setting this value to, say, 7 days, a filter
       will disappear automatically if it hasn't matched any articles in the
       past 7 days.<P></LI>

  <LI>The <B>Enable</B> checkbox toggles this filter on or off.  Filters that
       are not enabled have no effect; they simply are not used.<P></LI>

  <LI>The <B>Invert</B> checkbox inverts the sense of the filter; all
       articles it would normally match are not matched, and vice versa.  This
       way you can easily define filters that match all articles <U>except</U>
       those specified by the filter criteria.<P></LI>

  <LI>The <B>Toolbar Button</B> option allows you to define a graphic file
  which will be used to create a toolbar button for this filter.  This
  toolbar button appears in the <A HREF="NR-Tut-Group.html#FFTB">Group
  Window</A>, near the article view area, and clicking a filter's icon
  will toggle that filter on or off and update the list of articles
  accordingly.<P></LI>
</UL>

If neither the <B>Expire Date</B> nor the <B>Expire Disuse</B> options in
this area are selected, then the filter will never expire.<P>

The filter <B>description</B> may also be changed by typing into the name
box in a filter list when a particular filter is selected.  The
<B>Enabled</B> and <B>Invert</B> options may be toggled on and off from
the filter list by clicking in the appropriate column of the list:<P>

Certain information about filters is tracked to enable you to easily see
how filters are performing.  The statistics area looks like this:<P>

   <CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-SelFlt-Stats.GIF" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=160
        BORDER=0>
   </CENTER><P>

The <B>Total History</B> area presents a cumulative count of the number of
successful and attempted matches for this filter.  For example, if there
are 100 articles in a group, and a particular filter matches 35 of them,
then the components of the Total History area will increment by 35 and 100
respectively each time the filter is used.<P>

The <B>Last Use</B> area is similar, but it resets for each use of the
filter.  For example, if you perform some operation in the group window's
user interface that requires re-running filters, the Last Use area
statistics will reset each time.<P>

The <B>Last Match</B> is the date on which the filter last successfully
matched any article.  This is used to determine when to expire articles
that use the <B>Expire Disuse</B> feature.<P>

Pressing the <B>Reset</B> button will reset all the statistics to zero.<P>

Pressing the <B>Update</B> button will update the <B>Last Match</B> date
to today's date.  This way you can "force" a filter that would have
otherwise expired to start it's internal clock over, so to speak.<P>

Some other filter statistics such as a percentage match number are
available from the filter lists.<P>

When sharing filters with other people, it is often useful to include a
longer description of the filter so that other people can know what it
does without having to experiment with it themselves.  This is
particularly useful for complex filters.  For this reason, NewsRog allows
you to type some descriptive text into an Author Note:<P>

   <CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-SelFlt-AInfo.GIF" WIDTH=476 HEIGHT=160
        BORDER=0>

Saving & Loading Filters
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

Filters or groups of filters may be saved or loaded from disk files.
Pressing the right mouse button above a filter list will produce a popup
menu with "Save..." and "Load..." a few other options.<P>

By selecting one filter, or multiselecting several filters in the list,
and chosing the "Save..." menu, a file requester will appear asking for a
filename to which the selected filters should be saved.  If more than one
filter is selected, all the filters will be save to the file.  This way
filters may be saved for future use or for sharing with other NewsRog
users.<P>

By chosing the "Load..." menu, a file requester will appear asking for a
filename from which to load previously saved filters.  After chosing a
file, a list of the filters in the file will be displayed:<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-SelFlt-InsAdd.GIF" WIDTH=387 HEIGHT=268 BORDER=0>
</CENTER><P>

The list will present all of the filters from the file.  Double clicking
on a single filter will load that filter.  Multi-selecting a group of
filters and pressing the "Load" button will load those filters.  If the
filter has a Author Note, then this will be displayed when the name of the
filter is clicked in the list.<P>

The group list window looks like this.  The button icons at the top have
been explained in a <A HREF="NR-Tut-Com.html#Lists">previous tutorial</A>.
Other commands available here are:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Read Group</B> - This button will open the group window for the
      active (selected) group.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Mark as Read</B> - This will mark all articles in the selected
      groups as read.  This may take a few moments since the group
      headers must be read from the disk cache for each group and saved
      afterwards.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Mark as Unread</B> - Similar to the above, but all articles are
       marked as unread.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Update Count</B> - The count of new articles from the server
      (since the group was last read) is updated for the selected groups.
      Due to the pecularities of the news protocol, this count is almost
      always an overstatement of the actual number of new articles.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Read Description</B> - The group description for the selected
      groups is read from the news server.  This will be stored with the
      group so you generally only need to do this once, and then only if
      you want to display the information.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Batch D/L Overview</B> - The overview (header) information for
      the selected groups is fetched in batch mode.  This includes only
      the header fields, not the actual article bodies.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Batch D/L Articles</B> - The articles (including article bodies)
      from the selected groups (as well as the header information) are
      downloaded in batch mode.  This may take a while for large groups or
      those with large posts!  All of the articles fetched will be placed
      in the local disk cache, and the group may be read offline later on.
      Note that this is only one way to prepare for offline reading.
      Another is to select certain articles or threads in the group window
      and batch cache them from there.<P>

      When using the batch download features, a window similar to this one
      appears to report on the status of the download.  The indicated time
      remaining is only an estimate based on the transfer speeds so far
      and the amount yet to go, and may be inaccurate especially in the
      early part of the batch download.  The cancel button may be used to
      abort the operation.  If some articles have alreay been downloaded,
      these will be saved when the operation is aborted.<P>

        <CENTER>
          <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-Groups-BatchProg.GIF" WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=95>
        </CENTER><P>

      Note that <A HREF="#BatchDL">Batch D/L Filters</A> can be used to
      limit the download to certain articles.  For instance, you might
      wish to batch download only articles that are new since the last
      time, or only articles that are smaller than some particular size.
      <P></LI>

  <LI><B>Add Group</B> - Adds a new group; the name can be edited in the
      text box.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Sort</B> - Sort the group list by the most recently defined
      criteria.  For example, the last read date might have changed
      recently.  The group list can be resorted by using this button.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Select All</B> - Select all groups.  This is useful to, for
      example, update the count of all subscribed groups.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Show Groups...</B> - Show the list of groups available on the
      news server.<P></LI>

The article list can be set to display any desired information about a

            window icon for open or closed groups, or a broken group icon
            (<IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-Groups-WinBroke.GIF" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=10>)
            if a group is opened that could not be found on the news server.
            A closed icon with a small letter N inside
            (<IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-Groups-WinNew.GIF" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=12>)
            means that new articles have been batch-downloaded to this
            group since it was last opened.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Group Name</TD>
        <TD>Depending on other configuration settings, this can be either
            the full name of the group (e.g, <I>comp.sys.amiga.misc</I>),
            or the abbreviated name (e.g. <I>c.s.a.misc</I>).
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Last Read</TD>
        <TD>The date and time on which the group was last opened.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>New</TD>
        <TD>The number of new articles on the server since the group was
        last opened.  Due to the pecularities of the news protocol, this count
        is almost always an overstatement of the actual number of new articles.
        This number can be updated using the <B>Update Count</B> command,
        or by setting an automatic update interval in the configuration
        settings.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Group</TD>
        <TD>The number of articles in the group, locally, including both read
        and unread articles. This is updated when the headers are fetched
        from the server.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Read</TD>
        <TD>The number of articles in the group that have been read.  This is
        updated every time you read an article that was previously unread.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Unread</TD>
        <TD>The number of unread articles in the group.  This is
        updated every time you read an article that was previously unread.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Avail</TD>
        <TD>The total number of articles for this group available from the
        server.  For some large groups, you may want to configure NewsRog
        to fetch a less than this number.  Due to the pecularities of the
        news protocol, this number is usually an overstatement of the
        actual number of articles available from the server.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Description</TD>
        <TD>The group's description, as fetched from the server using the
        <B>Read Description</B> command.  It may also be set to any
        desired value from within the group window's configuration
        section, which is useful for groups that don't have a description
        on the server.  Setting only happens locally; nothing on the
        network or server is changed.
        </TD></TR>

    <TR><TD VALIGN=Top>Server</TD>
        <TD>The server from which to fetch this group.  Usually this is
        just the default server defined in the <A
        HREF="NR-Tut-Servers.html"> Servers Window </A>.

Group List Menus
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

In addition to the standard project related menus, the following group
list specific menus are available:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Groups/Import&nbsp;.newsrc</B> - This menu item will read a
  .newsrc file in the format saved by <I>tin</I> and some other
  newsreaders.  All the subscribed groups found in the .newsrc file will
  be subscribed to in the group list.  Only the group names are imported;
  the read article information cannot be imported to NewsRog.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Groups/All in Cache Dir</B> - It is possible for the cache
  directory to contain cached information about groups that are not in the
  project.  This can happen several ways; either projects can be deleted
  with the <B>Keep OV Dir</B> option selected, or the computer can be
  rebooted after adding groups but before the NewsRog project file is
  saved.  In any case, this menu option will subscribe to all the groups
  found in the cache directory.<P></LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="SGList"></A>

Server Group List
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-SGList.GIF" WIDTH=308 HEIGHT=259 ALIGN=Right
     HSPACE=10>

The server group list window looks like this.  Typing a pattern into the
text box and pressing return or the <B>Fetch</B> button will fetch the
groups on the server matching the given pattern.  Note that this pattern
is parsed on the server and is more restrictive than the normal AmigaOS
patterns.  Only a few features such as the "*" (asterisk) wildcard are
supported.<P CLEAR=Right>

The following commands are available in this window:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Fetch</B> - Fetch the groups matching the given pattern from the
      server.  Pressing return in the string gadget has the same effect.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Clear</B> - Clears the current list of groups.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Search...</B> - Opens up a search window.  The titlebar gadget
       has the same effect<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Sort</B> - Sort the list of groups by name.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Subscribe</B> - Subscribe to the currently selected (highlighted)
      groups.  Dragging a set of groups sideways out of this list and into
      the main group list window has the same effect.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Load</B> - Load a previously saved groups list.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Save</B> - Save the current list of groups to a file for later
      loading.  This file is ASCII and may be viewed with any text display
      program such as multiview.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Show New</B> - Show new groups on the server since the last time
  this option was used.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Browse</B> - Browse the group without subscribing to it.  If the
  group has already been subscribed to, it will be read normally.
  Otherwise, it may be read once a trial basis, but no cache files or
  article state is saved to disk when the group window is closed.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Abort</B> - Aborts the current transfer.  Only available while
      the list is being transferred.  In any case, the list will be
      updated periodically during the transfer.<P></LI>
</UL>

Note that there may potentially tens of thousands of groups on the server.
Fetching a pattern of "*" (asterisk) may download quite a few groups!
It's generally much faster to specify a pattern matching the general area
you are interested in, such as "*bicycles*" or "*amiga*".

  <CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-Groups-Opts.GIF" WIDTH=557 HEIGHT=244>
  </CENTER><P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Full Names</B> - If set, full group names (e.g.
  comp.sys.amiga.misc) are displayed instead of abbreviated names (e.g.
  c.s.a.misc). <P></LI>

  <LI><B>Update on Start</B> - If set, the count of new articles on the
  server will be updated any time the group list window is opened). <P></LI>

  <LI><B>Update Interval</B> - If set, the new article count is updated
  periodically at the given interval).  Reading a group will reset the new
  article count to zero.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Server Groups Upd Interval</B> - The update interval for the
  server groups list.  This may be increased or decreased as desired for
  network connections of different speeds.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Server Groups Pattern</B> - Only server groups matching this
  pattern will be listed in the server groups window.  This provides an
  easy way to ignore groups in languages you cannot read, while still
  searching for wildcard matches in the list of server groups.<P></LI>

Batch download filters use NewsRog <A HREF="NR-Tut-SelFlt.html"> selection
filters <A> to determine which articles will be downloaded during a batch
article download.  If any filters are present, then only articles which
match those filters will be downloaded.<P>

If a <I>Group Pattern</I> is given for a particular filter, then this
filter will only be applied when downloading articles in a group which
matches the group pattern.  You might, for example, use <I>comp.sys.*</I>
to make a filter apply to all groups in the comp.sys hierarchy.<P>

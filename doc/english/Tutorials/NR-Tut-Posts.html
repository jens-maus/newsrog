Posts in NewsRog are usually created by using commands available in the
group reader window.  However, they can also be directly created from
within the post queue.  The post queue holds a list of composed postings
that you have created.  These posts can be composed on or offline.  Once
one or more posts have been composed, they can all be sent to the network
in a batch mode.<P>

There are two specific post related windows; the <I>Post Queue</I> holds a
list of posts being composed that have not yet been sent to the network:<P>

  <CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-PostQueue.GIF" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=175
       ALIGN=Center BORDER=0>
  </CENTER><P>

And in the "Send Posts" area, a list of posts that have been sent to the
network:<P>

  <CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="../Graphics/Window-PostQueueS.GIF" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=175
       ALIGN=Center BORDER=0>
  </CENTER><P>


The <I>Post Editor</I> allows you to edit one particular post.<P>

NewsRog allows you to use any text editor that you chose to edit posts, or
you can use the builtin text editor shown here.  If you are using an
external text editor, as soon as that editor saves the file, NewsRog will
update it's own display in the post editor window.  AmigaOS file
notifications are used, so the editor can be run asynchronously and you
can save the file from the text editor as many times as you wish before
closing the editor.  The default external editor is c:ed, but this can be
changed in the <A HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#MiscOpts">global configuration
options.</A><P>

There are several ways to create new posts:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Using the <B>Group/Post&nbsp;New...</B> or
     <B>Viewer&nbsp;Article/Post&nbsp;Followup...</B> menu items in the
     group window.<P></LI>

  <LI>Dragging an article from the article list in a group window onto the
      post queue window.  This will compose a followup to the article,
      quoting the original article text.<P></LI>

  <LI>Dragging a group from the group list window onto the post queue
      window.  This will compose a new post to that group.<P></LI>

  <LI>Adding a post manually by using the <B>Add</B> button in the post
      queue window shown above.  In this case you will need to enter both
      the subject and group information by hand.<P></LI>
</UL><P>

Under normal operation using the group reader <B>Followup</B> or
<B>Post&nbsp;New</B> commands, the post queue window does not appear.
Instead, a post editor for that post appears directly.<P>

  <CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="../Graphics/NR-Tut-Posts-PopEdit.GIF" WIDTH=425 HEIGHT=166
       ALIGN=Center BORDER=0>

The left section is the list of groups to which this article will be sent
(or the list of groups in the followup list, if editing the Followups-To
header).  The right section is the list of groups you have subscribed to.
You may multiselect one or more group names from the right side and drag
them onto the left to add those groups to the crosspost list for this
article, or you may drag groups from the left side to the right to remove
them from the crosspost list.<P>

You may also drag newsgroups out of the <A HREF="NR-Tut-Groups.html">Group
List</A> window and drop them on the left side to add them to the post
list.<P>

Any changes you make will be immediately reflected in the group string
above the popup list.<P>

Press the popup button again, or the close button, to close the list.<P>

Pressing the "Delete" button will delete the selected groups from the
list.  Pressing "Restore" will return the list to the value it had before
you invoked the popup group list editor.<P>

The post editor may be toggled between the "Edit Post" mode, in which the
post may be edited, and "View Wrapped" mode, which shows the post wrapped
to the number of characters specified in the
<A HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#PostOpts">main configuration window.<A>
The post will be wrapped when it is posted, but if you have an external
editor such as GNU emacs that performs this function, you may do it there
as well.<P>

<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-eb_CustHdrs.GIF" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=16

If this gadget is checked, then any custom headers defined in
the <A HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#Headers">main configuration window</A>
will be transmitted along with this post when it is sent to the
news server.  Otherwise, custom headers are ignored.<P>

Text buttons along the bottom of the window provide these functions:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Post now</B> - Sends the post in its current form to the network.
      This is only available in online mode.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Invoke Editor</B> - Invokes an external editor to edit the post.
      Any time the editor saves the file, this view will be instantly
      updated.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>To Queue</B> - Closes this window and puts the post in its
      current form back into the post queue for later editing or batch
      posting.  This can be done in either online or offline mode.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Cancel</B> - Cancels all the edits to the post text that were
      performed since the post editor was opened, and reverts to the
      previous version.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Delete</B> - Deletes this post from the post queue and closes the
      editor window.  This removes the post entirely.<P></LI>

Preview & Post Wrapping

By default, the lines you type into the post editor are not rewrapped
until you send the post to the network.  You can change this behavior in
the the <A HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#PostOpts">main configuration window</A>, but
wrapping lines at the last possible moment has the advantage that if you
edit a post multiple times, you don't have to manually adjust the line
breaks each time, a problem common to other software.<P>

<IMG SRC="../Graphics/Button-eb_EditModeVR.GIF" WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=21

However, it is desirable to know what your post will look
like before sending it to the network.
Toggling The Edit Mode button to <B>View Wrapped</B> will let you see the
results of line wrapping on your post.  It is wise to always double check
the formatting of your post before sending it to the network!<P>

There are other options available in this cycle gadget for previewing
posts.  The available settings are:<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>View Wrapped</B> - As described above, this shows you the post
  body after line wrapping, as it will be sent to the network.</LI><P>
  <LI><B>View All</B> - Similar to View Wrapped, but shows the complete
  set of article headers as well.</LI><P>
  <LI><B>View Encoding</B> - This shows you the post to be transmitted
  with any
  <A HREF="#MIME">MIME encoding</A> visible.  You may see the results of
  quoted-printable encoding in your message body or article headers if
  your article contains non-ASCII characters and you have selected
  Quoted-Printable encoding in the <A
  HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#PostOpts">configuration window</A>.
  </LI><P>
</UL><P>

<A NAME="MIME"></A>

<TR>
<TD ALIGN=Center VALIGN=Top WIDTH=120 BGCOLOR=#777799><FONT SIZE=+2>
MIME & Non-ASCII Encoding
<FONT SIZE=+0> </TD>
<TD>

Many aspects of the internet in general, and usenet in particular, were
originally developed many years ago before it was common to support
characters from languages other than English in computer software. Thus,
only 7-bit ASCII data (characters in the range from 0-127) is guaranteed
to be transmitted cleanly through usenet and many other internet services.<P>

To address this limitation, the MIME standard specifies a quoted-printable
encoding scheme in which non-ASCII characters are translated into a unique
sequence of 3 ASCII characters, and the reverse transformation is applied
when viewing the article at its destination.  This makes it much more
likely that the article will be transmitted without loss of non-ASCII
characters.<P>

NewsRog will examine your post before sending it to detect whether it
contains non-ASCII characters, and if so, it will generate a text/plain
MIME document using the quoted-printable encoding scheme if you have
selected Quoted-Printable encoding in the <A
HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#PostOpts">configuration window</A>.
This is <U>only</U> done for documents that contain one or more non-ASCII
characters.  A great many people read usenet using software that is not
able to decode quoted-printable encoding.  Quoted-printable encoding is
"mostly" human readable, but there are limitations which make it
preferable to avoid when possible.<P>

When posting in quoted-printable format, NewsRog will generate "soft"
line-breaks for lines who's encoded length exceeds 75 characters, and will
encode whitespace at the end of lines, non-ASCII characters, and the ASCII
equal ('=') sign using quoted-printable character encoding, which looks
like an equals sign followed by two hex digits when viewed without being
decoded.  For this reason your article may appear less than optimally
readable for those using non-MIME aware newsreaders.  This is generally
perfectly fine for non-English newsgroups where most people are
using MIME aware newsreaders, but should be avoided if possible in English
language groups.<P>

<B>Note:</B> The presence of non-ASCII characters in a signature file is
also sufficient to trigger quoted-printable encoding!<P>

When transmitting a MIME text document, NewsRog will include the value of
the <A HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#PostOpts">charset</A> that you have
defined in the main configuration window.  This tells software on the
reader's computer what codeset your article was created using.  Note that
the MIME standard requires that <B>only</B> the ISO-8869-X codesets be
used for transmitting posts.<P>

You may use the <A HREF="#Preview">View Encoding</A> preview mode to see
the results of quoted-printable encoding if it has been performed on your
article.<P>

You may also chose 8-bit encoding in the <A
  HREF="NR-Tut-Config.html#PostOpts">configuration window</A>, although
this technically violates RFC822 and is not recommended.<P>

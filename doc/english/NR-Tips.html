Here are some tips on configuring your system to obtain the best possible
performance from NewsRog.<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Modem compression</B><P>
  If you connect to an ISP using a
  modem, turn on modem compression and use the maximum possible serial
  speed.  Fast Amigas can support serial speeds up to 115200 bps.  Since
  items such as newsgroup headers are easily compressed, this can often
  lead to transfers much faster than the external connection speed of your
  modem.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Disk Cache</B> <P>
  NewsRog reads and writes header cache files for
  various newsgroups.  Using a disk cache program that supports
  write-ahead can immensely improve the speed of entering and exiting
  newsgroups.<P></LI>
       
  <LI><B>HeaderMatch Filter</B><P>
  Using static strings instead of patterns
  in the <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-HeaderMatch.html">HeaderMatch</A> filter
  can improve the speed of matching manyfold.<P></LI>

Filter Tips

These tips can help you set up useful selection filters.

<UL>
  <LI><B>Local vs. global filters</B><P> If a filter is to be used in more
  than one place, it is usually best to define it once in the
  <A HREF="Tutorials/NR-Tut-Config.html">configuration</A> area and use a
  group pattern, if required, to control the set of groups to which the
  filter should apply.  This way, the filter only needs to be changed once
  instead of in multiple locations.<P></LI>

  <LI><B>Making a filter to show all threads you've posted to</B><P>
     Creating different selection filters to show different views of a
     newsgroup is a very powerful and useful technique.  For example, try
     defining a
     <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-MatchThread.html">MatchThread</A> filter,
     add setting the sub-filter to a
     <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-HeaderMatch.html">HeaderMatch</A> on your
     email address.  With a few mouseclicks, you can now toggle on this
     filter from the group reader window and show only those threads in
     which you have been participating.  This makes it easy to temporarily
     ignore all the other threads in the group.
     <P></LI>

  <LI><B>Killing all followups to a particular author.</B><P>
     Most newsreaders provide you the ability to kill articles based on
     the author.  This is useful to ignore authors who post nothing but
     posts designed to annoy or disrupt the group.  But with NewsRog you
     can go a step futher: you can ignore all <I>followups</I> to such a
     person as well, no matter who posted the followup.  This lets you
     easily remove large flame wars started by a few obnoxious
     individuals.  Try using a
     <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-MatchFollowup.html">MatchFollowup</A>
     filter containing a
     <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-HeaderMatch.html">HeaderMatch</A>
     filter that matches the email addresses of the offending persons.
     <P></LI>

  <LI><B>Browsing posts by your favorite authors</B><P>
     You might define a
     <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-HeaderMatch.html">HeaderMatch</A>
     filter listing various authors who you have determined to be
     worthwhile to read, perhaps including it in a
     <A HREF="Reference/NR-Ref-MatchFollowup.html">MatchFollowup</A>
     filter.

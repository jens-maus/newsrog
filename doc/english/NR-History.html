  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Headers can be displayed in an arbitrary order,
    selectable via drag and drop.  The HideHeader display filter now
    permits a list of AmigaOS patterns to be entered.  Headers will be
    displayed in the order they are matched by the patterns.  If the
    pattern matches more than one header, the matched headers will be
    displayed in the order they are found in the article.  See the

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A URL that contains a string that looks like an email address
    is now displayed correctly.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a line wrap formatting option to the EmpHeader
    display filter which allows certain headers, such as Newsgroups: and
    References:, to have each of their entries displayed on a separate
    line.  This avoids very long header lines for these fields.  See the
    reference documentation for the EmpHeader filter for more information.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>When saving file from MIME or UUencoded data blocks, NR
    will prompt if the file to be written already exists.  You may save
    over the old file, chose a new filename, or cancel the operation.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The Save/Save As/Action buttons in data blocks now occupy
    the left 50% of the block width, to make them easier to access for
    very wide images.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new "Start Article" setting in the main
    configuration which controls the positioning of the cursor when a
    group window is opened.  The cursor may be placed on the article it
    was on when the group was last closed (unless that article has
    expired), on the thread entry point of that article, or on the first
    or last articles in the article list.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a "Browse Articles" setting in the main
    configuration which determines which articles are skipped and which
    are shown when using the article browsing commands (such as +/- or
    page up/down on the numeric keypad).  You can chose to browse all
    articles (the default), only unread articles, only new articles, or
    both.  Broken articles are skipped in all cases and must be retried by
    double clicking on them or using the return key.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The ARexx DISPART command now accepts Message-ID's as
    well as an ordinal list position.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The text selection mechanism does not start selecting text
    until the mouse cursor has moved two pixels.  This means that a single
    character is no longer copied to the clipboard when clicking on email
    address, URL's, or other clickable links.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The default pattern for the save and insert requestors in the
    multimedia actions list has been changed to "MMAction.*".</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is an autosave option in the project area of the
    configuration window which will autosave the NewsRog project each time
    a group window is closed (unless it is closed via the "Close (NoSave)"
    menu option.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Test posts to non-test groups are now detected, and
    NewsRog offers the choice of sending the post to alt.test, cancelling
    the post and returning to the post editor, or proceding with the post
    anyway.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>When opening a group window, NewsRog now starts the
    article list cursor on the same article it was left on when the group
    was last closed, if that article is still available, even if that
    article is not a thread base article.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a ${getenv} function to return the value of an
    AmigaOS environment variable.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a ${concat} function to concatenate words with a
    specified separator string between them.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a ${default} function to return the value of a
    variable, if it is bound, or a given string otherwise.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a ${replace} function to replace a given
    substring in a string with a new substring.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is experimental support for defining functions
    within the variable language.  See the variable reference
    documentation for details.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The EMail display filter now has a feature for detecting
    article Message-ID's.  The Message-ID format is &lt;idstring@host.addr&gt;
    which also happens to be the most common format for writing email
    addresses as well, so most newsreaders cannot tell the difference
    between the two when such a string occurs in an article body.
    However, NewsRog has a heuristic which can tell the difference with an
    accuracy in excess of 99% (just 4 of over 3500 such strings randomly
    selected from the alt.test group were misidentified).  Message-ID's
    have a NewsRog MIME type of application/X-MsgID, and you may define
    popup menu multimedia actions for them just like for email addresses
    or URL's.  When clicking with the left mouse button on a Message-ID,
    NewsRog will move to that message in the article list and display the
    message if it is available.  When clicking with the right mouse
    button, a popup menu displaying the multimedia actions for
    application/X-MsgID is displayed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>
        Holding down the alt key while selecting text in the
    clipboard will allow you to multiselect several regions of text, and
    will bypass the AutoClip feature if it is turned on.  For instance,
    you can alt-doubleclick to select a word, move the mouse cursor to
    another word, and alt-doubleclick to select that word and drag to
    select several more adjacent ones, while leaving the first word
    selected.  By itself this is not useful, but it is meant for use in
    conjunction with other features which allow actions to be performed on
    selected text.<P>

    </CENTER>
    </TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>Since the article view area now has a popup menu, the 
    group window menus are no longer available when the mouse cursor is
    over this area.  Instead, move the mouse cursor elsewhere in the
    window to access the group window menus.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Text that is selected in the article viewer may be used
    in multimedia actions.  The NewsRog MIME type is application/X-Text,
    and you may define multimedia actions that will appear in a popup menu
    when the right mouse button is pressed over the article view area.
    The variable ${SelTxt} may be used in a multimedia action and will
    return the currently selected text.  It has several optional
    parameters; see the variable reference documentation for details.<P>

    There are many potential uses for this, including interfacing NewsRog
    to web search engines and translation services.  For example, perhaps
    you are reading the newsgroup sci.space.news and see an article text
    about NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft.  You can
    alt-double-click the word NASA, and separately alt-double-click and
    drag over Mars Climate Orbiter, and then select "Search:Yahoo" from
    the NewsRog popup context menu.  NewsRog will then formulate a query
    to the Yahoo web directory asking for pages about both NASA and "Mars
    Climate Orbiter"!<P>

    You may load multimedia actions for several popular web search
    directories from the Objects subdirectory of NewsRog by clicking the
    "Insert..." button under the Multimedia Actions tab and double
    clicking the files.  If you have a NewsRog variable called "Browser"
    defined, this will be used as your web browser.  Otherwise,
    Work:IBrowse/IBrowse is used as the default.<P>

    Please see the new NewsRog tutorial #16 on this topic for more
    information.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Action filters now have an option for marking articles as
    read after they have been processed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Spaces in a newsgroups list will be automatically removed
    before a post is sent to the network.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>
    There is a popup crosspost editor list available in the
    post list window.  You can drag groups from the main group list
    window, the server group list, or the list of subscribed groups on the
    right side of the popup window, into the lefthand list to add them to
    the crosspost list for this article.  You can remove them using the
    delete button or by dragging groups from the left list into the right
    one.  See the Posts tutorial for more information.<P>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Using the kill articles option in the group window would not
    work unless there was an active article in the article list.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new placement option for the filter function
    toolbar; the icons may be placed with those that are already part of
    the article view toolbar.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Highlight filters were not being run after a batch download.
    They now are.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The MIME type message/rfc822 is now displayed as an
    imbedded message in a multipart MIME document.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is now a selectable preferences setting which will
    chose between quoted-printable encoding and 8bit (no encoding) when
    posting articles containing non-ASCII data.  This can be controlled
    separately for post bodies and post headers.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Previously, if an article was aborted in mid-transfer (for
    instance, if the abort button is pushed before it was done loading),
    the article would not be re-fetched from the network the next time it
    was displayed.  Now it will be.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If nested group-specific filters were used, editing one of
    them and then closing the group would cause NewsRog to crash.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>
    The Rewrap display filter can now detect tabular data and
    display it in a fixed sized font with no line wrapping even if the
    rest of the article is displayed in a proportional font.  This feature
    is disabled by default; it must be explicitly enabled by editing the
    Rewrap filter and clicking on the "Table Heuristics" checkbox.  This
    feature will allow you to use an easy to read proportional font for
    reading article text, yet have items such as Aminet charts or a table
    of race results displayed in a logical manner without having to turn
    off the rewrap filter to avoid rewrapping the table lines.  For example:<P>

    <CENTER>
    <IMG  SRC="Graphics/NR-Ref-Rewrap-Ex4.GIF" WIDTH=344 HEIGHT=143 BORDER=0>
    </CENTER><P>

    Note that there is no information in usenet posts to indicate what is
    and is not a table.  Although NewsRog uses an advanced heuristic for
    detecting tables which typically works quite well, this can never be
    done perfectly.  It is quite possible for NewsRog to miss some types
    of tables, particularly if they are small or not well formatted.  But
    in most cases, this feature works quite well.<P>

    Please see the reference documentation for the Rewrap filter for more
    information on automated table detection.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The Rewrap filter has been rewritten for improved performance
    on very large posts.  There should be no significant behavioral
    differences.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The Rewrap filter would previously insert an extra blank line
    when quoted text ended at the right hand wrap border.  This no longer
    happens.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Previously, it was possible for the rewrap filter to enter
    an infinite loop if a very long word that would not fit on a single
    line was present with whitespace before it in the original post.  This
    has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>If the character before a URL matched by the URL filter
    is an open parenthesis, then any closing parenthesis as the last
    character of a URL will be removed.  This allows URLs to contain
    parentheses in cases such as:<P>

      <UL>HTTP://www.foo.bar/some/path/(with_parens)</UL>

    but will not include parentheses in the URL when the entire URL is
    enclosed by them, as in:<P>

      <UL>(HTTP://www.foo.bar/)</UL>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B> New Feature</B></TD><TD> When searching through cached article bodies, a new
    option is available to pre-load them all into memory (if enough free
    memory is available - NewsRog will not do this if less than 4 Mb would
    be free after they are loaded).  This can reduce the time for
    searching through 200 article bodies from 6 seconds down to 0.4
    seconds on an 060.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B> New Feature</B></TD><TD> When searching through article bodies, a progress

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a posting rate filter which can select
    threads according to the number of posts they get per unit time
    period.  This is useful for showing very active or very inactive
    threads.  It's not as useful as a kill filter, because killing
    articles affects the number of articles in the thread, and thus
    the posting rate statistics. </TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>

    Filters can now have a user defined toolbar icon
    which can be used to toggle that filter on/off and update the article
    list or article view with a single click.  This makes commonly used
    filters easier to access.  The Filter Toolbar Location setting in the
    Program Options / Window Options configuration area controls the
    location of this toolbar in the group window.  There is also an option
    available for including a filter's description as a label under the
    filter icon, in which case it will be set to bold text when the filter
    is enabled, and standard text otherwise.  For example:<P>

    <CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="Graphics/Window-Grp-FFTB.GIF" WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=286 BORDER=0>
    </CENTER><P>

    There are several 24-bit 50x30 icons supplied in the Images/Filter
    directory of NewsRog.  These icons are designed for use on truecolor
    (16 or 24 bit) displays in at least 800x600 resolution.  They are not
    optimal for register screens (less than or equal to 256 colors),
    but any graphic for which there is a datatype present on your system
    may be used as a button image.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The "Any/All" gadgets in filter lists now have bubble
    help.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Information about the Any/All mode of filters has been

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A print menu is available in the group menu structure
    which can be used to send the currently display article (with or
    without headers) to the printer.  The printer device is defined in
    the configuration window under Program Options / Misc Options /
    Printer Device.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A Spoiler display filter is available which can

    separated by a formfeed character.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The algorithm for generating abbreviations from user names

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> Although NewsRog's variable strings are not intended to

    has been added to the variable lookup language.  These include:<P>

    For full details on these functions, see the Functions section of the
    variable reference documentation.  Note that if a function is
    cumbersomely long for inclusion in a single string gadget, it is often
    useful to create custom variables for subsections of it in the
    Variables tab of the Config window, a tactic which also allows its use
    from multiple locations without repeating the source.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The PRI option to the ${exec} function was being ignored.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> Display filters can now modify article text when it is
    saved to a disk file, printed, or used in generating a reply.  There
    are new options in the Global Info tab of the filter editor which
    control this behavior.  "Enabled" acts as it always has; if this is
    checked, then the filter is used to modify displayed articles.  if
    "For Printing" is checked, it is also used to modify article text for
    printing.  "Saving" does similar for article text saved to a disk
    file, and "Replies" uses the filter when generating replies to
    articles.<P>

    Not all filters can be used in this manner.  It only applies to
    textual modifications.  For example, the URL filter, which generates
    clickable URL links for articles displayed in the article view area,
    cannot be used to modify a pure text stream, so these options are
    unavailable in its editor window.  Some filters also act in a
    different manner when used to process text in this fashion.  For
    instance, the uudecode filter removes binaries entirely instead of
    displaying them as inline graphics.<P>

    Some filters have additional parameters to control their operation
    when used to modify replies or saved/printed text.  For example, the
    Rewrap filter usually wraps proportional text to a given percentage of
    the total display width.  When used as a text-only filter, it can wrap
    to a user defined number of columns, such as 72.<P>

    If the MIME filter is enabled for replies, it will decode
    quoted-printable text before importing it into the post editor.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The HTML dimensions of the Server Groups' window in tutorial
    #5 were incorrect.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The HTML documentation has many new screenshots and extensive
    additions in many areas.  Screenshots from older versions of
    NewsRog have been updated to reflect the most current version, and a
    number of ommissions have been corrected.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The SP=STARTPROJ/K command line option has been changed
    to SP=STARTPROJ/M, which allows a project name to be given on the
    command line without the use of the STARTPROJ or SP keywords.  Only
    one project name is permitted.  If present, the SP=STARTPROJ keyword
    works as before.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The memory cache algorithm for article data has been changed
    so that the currently displayed article will never be deleted from the
    memory cache even if it is larger than the current memory cache
    settings for that group.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> If the "Mem cache articles" setting for the group was a
    multiple of 16, memory corruption would result when the memory cached
    filled up.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Reading articles of various sizes in certain combinations
    could result in a memory cache related crash.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A new button and key combination is available for
    removing selected articles or threads from the current article list
    without killing those articles.  Lower case 'z' will remove selected
    articles, and upper case 'Z' will remove all articles in the same
    threads as the selected articles.  This functionality is also
    available from new "Article_List/Remove/Selected_Articles" and
    "Selected_Threads" menus.  Articles removed in such a manner will be
    visible the next time the group is opened (unless they were expired or
    removed via some other means), and can be restored to the current view
    at any time by using the new "Article_List/Remove/UnRemove" menu
    option.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Some (broken) news servers return a successful return code
    from the NNTP ARTICLE/HEAD/BODY commands (return codes 220, 221, 222),
    but then do not return any lines of text.  Previously, this would
    crash NewsRog.  This is extremely poor behavior on the part of a news
    server, but the error is now handled successfully in NewsRog, which
    will display a broken icon next to that article.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a settable policy option in the main config
    window which controls NewsRog's behavior if the number of articles to
    be downloaded from a group exceeds the group's Max Articles count.
    You may chose to silently ignore the oldest articles, or to download
    all articles (ignoring the Max Articles setting), or to prompt for
    what to do (only for non-batch operations).</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The maximum number of articles to download in a group,
    and the number of article headers to keep when the group window is
    closed, are now separate controls and may be adjusted independently.
    Unless it is set separately, the "Max to Keep on Exit" parameter
    defaults to the value of MaxArticles for that group, so the behavior
    is the same as in version 1.6.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The MIME display filter now has a "No-Display Types"
    setting, which can be set to an AmigaOS pattern matching zero or
    more MIME types which will not be displayed.  This is useful for
    filtering out things such as text/html.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The BadWrap Fix option is now on by default in the Rewrap
    display filter.  This will not affect old projects, only newly created
    Rewrap filters after version 1.7.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The default UI mode for the HLQuotes option is now scrolled
    quote blocks, rather than toggled quote blocks.  This will not affect
    old projects, only newly created HLQuotes filters after version 1.7.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Continuation lines in article headers are handled better now.
    These would occasionally break things in version 1.6 and older, such
    as references threading or certain MIME features.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Some MIME-encoded images are posted with the filename in the
    filename attribute of the Content-Disposition field rather than the
    more standard name attribute of the Content-Type field.  The MIME
    display filter now handles both cases.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> If there are non-ASCII characters present in a post (or
    the associated sig file), it will be transmitted as a text/plain MIME
    document using quoted-printable encoding in the character set you have
    specified in the main config window.  There is not yet a provision for
    attaching binary files such as images to posts.  Note that while such
    a document is mostly human-readable, the quoted-printable encoding
    enforces certain restrictions.  For example, lines longer than 75
    characters _after_ encoding will be transmitted as a sequence of multiple
    lines with one or more "soft" linebreaks, and thus may appear to be
    wrapped in a less than readable manner on newsreaders without MIME
    support.  There are similar limitations for whitespace at the end of
    lines and for the transmission of an ASCII equal ('=') sign.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The character set used for composing and reading posts is
    now settable in the main configuration window.  This should match the
    character set used by your font(s).  ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) is common
    for Amiga fonts but there are other possible choices.  This setting
    will be transmitted as the charset parameter of the MIME Content-Type
    field when you post a document that requires quoted-printable
    encoding.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The post editor has a new preview mode accessed via the
    same cycle gadget that has always switched between the editor and
    preview modes.  The new preview mode "View Encoding" will display the
    raw quoted-printable encoding of the current document, both headers
    and body lines.  In this mode you may see quoted-printable encoding
    markers such as "=3D", and soft line breaks.  The other preview modes
    ("View Wrapped", and "View All") show the actual characters in the
    post, and you will not see the quoted-printable encoding.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A CharMap display filter is available which can perform
    user defined display time character set translations.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> A memory leak in the author note feature of filters has been
    fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The HELP and USAGE command line options now print the
    NewsRog usage template to stdout.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new column in the group list is available which
    displays the moderation status of a group.  This information defaults
    to No (not moderated) and is only updated if you perform a "Read
    Description" operation on that group.  Thereafter it will be stored
    with the group, so this only needs to be done once.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>Parantheses are no longer added as part of a user name
    abbreviation.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Using the "Limit to Selected" group window menu option with
    no articles selected would result in NewsRog getting stuck in an
    infinite loop. The same bug was causing one fewer articles than were
    actually selected to be displayed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The minimum stack size for NewsRog has been increased to 80 Kb.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Some controls in the multimedia actions editor were not
    tab-selectable from the keyboard.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> It is now possible to send ARexx commands to other
    ARexx clients directly from NewsRog.  There is a toggle button in the
    Multimedia Actions list which can be set to CLI or ARexx.  When set to
    ARexx, a port name and ARexx command string can be set; other
    parameters such as stack size and task priority are ignored.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The MUI preferences editor for the built in text editor used
    for editing posts is now installed correctly.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> For NNTP servers on nonstandard ports, a port number may
    be defined for each NNTP server.  The default is 119.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The timezone offset was being added instead of substracted.
    This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The built in text editor's cursor now starts at the top of the
    post if the post is longer than one screen.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a new BUTTONPATH command line option which can
    define a search path for loading NewsRog's button graphics.  This path
    is a comma separated list of AmigaOS pathnames.  Any button image not
    found in the search path will be loaded from the standard location.
    The tooltype abbreviation is BP.  For example:<P>
       <UL>
       NewsRog SP Project.AmiGrps BP SYS:Graphics/NRButtons/Set1
       </UL></TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The left and right numeric keypad keys (4 & 6) now scroll
    the displayed article sideways.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The year 2000 leapyear calculation was incorrect and has been
    fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a "Server Groups Pattern" setting in the Group
    List window which can be used to define which groups will be listed in
    the server group's window.  For example, if you cannot speak Japanese
    and are not interested in Microsoft groups, you might wish to use a
    pattern such as "~(jp.*|microsoft.*)".  Then, the list of server
    groups will be restricted to those matching the given pattern.  This
    can be useful to narrow down a very large list of matching groups to
    those which you can read or are interested in.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The server group update interval when reading group names
    from the server can now be set in the Group List's options settings.
    The default is to update the display every 100 articles, but this can
    be changed to suit faster or slower network connections.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> Although true support for multipart posts is still being
    developed, several new features have been provided to make these
    easier to handle.  There are new article variables ${ArtPartNum} and
    ${ArtPartTot} which return, respectively, the current and maximum part
    numbers for articles in a multipart series.  For example, for an
    article with the subject "Some Article [1/3]", these values would be "1"
    and "3". Using ${ArtPartNum,3} would return "001" instead of "1".
    These can be used when saving files with a SaveTxt filter to include
    the part number in the filename.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A new group window menu command will select all related
    segments of a multipart post.  I.e, if the active article's title is
    "Some Article [2/3]", then parts [1/3] and [3/3] will also be
    selected, if they are visible in the current article list view.  Any
    missing parts will be reported.<P>

    More transparent support for multipart documents will appear in a
    future version of NewsRog.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The group window's menus now include a "Group Stats..."
    entry which will display a window containing some information about
    the group, such as the number of articles that have been killed, the
    total size in Kb/Mb of the cached & permanent articles, etc.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The article list window (and article view window, if it
    is separate) can now be moved to the back or front from the keyboard.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A new ARexx WINCTRL command can move the article list and
    article view windows for a given group to the back or front.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> The heuristic for telling a quote prefix from an accidental
    occurrence of the same string has been improved.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The post queue window now has a separate area where posts
    that have been sent to the network are archived.  The maximum number
    of posts archived here is defined in the "Max Saved Posts" setting in
    the Post Options area of the global configuration window.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Previously, copying text to the clipboard from an article
    view would sometimes leave out newlines, making one line where
    there had been two.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a new Decode action filter which can save MIME
    or UUEncoded binary data to disk files.  This is useful for batch
    decoding pictures or other types of data without requiring the use of
    an external command for this purpose.  The reference section of the

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Using the "Viewer Article/Redisplay/Raw" menu item while an
    article was in the middle of transferring from the network would
    display the partial article without updating when the article was
    finished transferring.  This menu item now has no effect unless the

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Updating from very early versions of NewsRog (1.0 or 1.1)
    with the supplied update scripts did not update one of the shared
    libraries, which would cause a crash when editing filters in version
    1.5.  Running the new update script will make the appropriate changes
    to the library.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>the XOVER header fetch method would sometimes ignore article
    posted to more than one group.  It has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The logfile destination in the update installer script is now
    set to the NewsRog install directory.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>If no server is defined in NewsRog, and an operation
    causes network I/O, then the value of the NNTPSERVER environment
    variable is used to create a new server dynamically, if that variable
    is defined.  This makes "scratch projects" easier to use.  To set up
    an NNTPSERVER environment variable, type this in a CLI window:<P>
       <UL>
         SetEnv NNTPSERVER your.newsserver.name
       </UL></TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The update installer script will now accept either the

    itself, when asking for the location of NewsRog.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The installer update script now functions better from the
    command line, since it no longer requires the APPNAME tooltype or

  <TR><TH></TH><TH>Changes for NewsRog 1.5</TH></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A kill filter bug introduced in version 1.4 is fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> More types of illegal email addresses are checked for before
    posting the article to the network, such as addresses with two '@'
    signs.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is an option to control the interval at which the
    article list updates while headers are being loaded from the network.
    The default is for the list to update every 100 articles, but you
    might increase this for faster network connections or decrease it for
    slower as you see fit.  The new articles will be threaded in with the
    other articles each time the list is updated, which can incur some
    overhead on slower machines.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> When doing certain operations such as batch downloading
    articles, NewsRog can issue multiple commands at once before waiting
    for the first to finish.  In most situations, this can drastically
    increase streaming throughput.  However, a few types of news servers
    do not handle this very well, and there is a new option in NewsRog to
    control the maximum number of simultaneous commands NewsRog will try
    to issue at once.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a new method of fetching headers which can
    achieve much higher performance on certain types of servers.  You can
    now choose between the original type, which downloads all the headers
    for each article, or a new overview type on servers that support the
    NNTP XOVER command.  Some servers implement XOVER in a very slow
    manner which does not have acceptable performance, while others are
    extremely fast.  Now you can chose which style of header fetching you
    prefer and which works best in your environment.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is a new option under the windows config tab which
    allows group windows to be opened in one of two modes.  The first mode
    is identical to that in NewsRog &lt;= 1.4, with the article list and
    article reader window combined into a single Amiga window.  An
    additional, new mode allows the article list and the article view to
    be in separate windows, which can be preferable on low resolution
    displays.  If the article list window is active, the numeric keypad
    keys still scroll/page the article in the article viewer window.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> In "All Articles" mode, using the thread-movement commands
    will no longer move to "One Thread" mode.  Instead, the current mode
    is retained and the current article marker will move to the next or
    previous thread.  Of course, the thread movement correctly follows
    references, so it skips articles in the same thread which have had the
    subject changed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> A "Read &amp; Cache" option has been added to the group
    configuration under "Cache Options".  If selected, articles that are
    read interactively are copied to the local disk cache as they are
    read.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The URL and EMail display plugins have an option to
    require a doubleclick to invoke their intended actions, rather than
    the standard singleclick.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> Variables (excepting article variables) may now be
    used in the HeaderMatch filter.  This allows one to use variables such
    as ${UserEmail} as a pattern in the filter, which will be expanded
    when the filter is run.  This is often easier than hardcoding such
    strings, since the filter need not be changed if the account
    information in NewsRog is changed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The URL filter would sometimes fail to detect URL's that in
    fact matched the given pattern.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Some newsgroups with an empty description would cause NewsRog
    to display garbage when the "Read Description" button was used.  Doing
    this operation again on those groups should now fix the problem.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There are a series of new article variables which provide
    for better formatting of the article's datestamp.  See the reference
    section of the documentation for details.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> If a posting fails for some reason, the error text from
    the news server is reported by NewsRog.  This can aid in finding the
    cause of the post failure.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> There is an option under "Program Options/Post Options"
    in the config area which allows the defined external editor to be
    launched automatically as soon as the post editor window is opened.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> In keeping with the NewsRog tradition of providing
    cutting-edge features to deal with Usenet, the HLQuotes and Rewrap
    display filters now include new, advanced heuristics for matching
    quote prefixes.  For instance, the string "so: " occuring at the
    beginning of a line might be part of some english text such as:<P>
       <UL><I>
       so: I said to him that he should not...
       </I></UL><P>
    in which case this line is not part of a quotation, and should not be
    colorized or rewrapped as if it was.  On the other hand, the very same
    prefix string might sometimes be part of a quoted text block quoting
    somebody named Sam Ospry, as in:<P>
       <UL><I>
       Sam Ospry <samosp@foo.bar.com> writes:<P>
       so: Some text written by Sam Ospry...
       </I></UL><P>

    In which case it *should* be colorized and rewrapped as a quote.  The
    new heuristics attempt to distinguish these two cases and act
    appropriately in each case.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> If the multimedia type of uuencoded data could not be
    determined from the defined media types, then NewsRog could crash when
    displaying the data.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> In some cases, DOS paths in uuencoded filenames could cause a
    requestor for drive "D:", etc to appear.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> Certain headers were being parsed in a case sensitive manner
    in some places, rather than case insensitive as should have been the
    case.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD> In previous versions, articles selected for display were
    inserted in a group's download queue and fetched after the currently
    downloading article, if any, was done.  Now, if such articles are
    already present in the local cache (for example, they have been
    prefetched, or cached explicitly), then they are displayed
    immediately.  This improves the interactive response.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> In certain cases when NewsRog variable names were more than
    24 characters longer than their value, memory corruption could occur.
    This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The variable lookup mechanism can now call an external
    program to determine the value of a variable.  The format is:<P>
       <UL>
       ${exec CMD="command" ARGS="args" PRI=pri STACK=stack}
       </UL><P>
    where everything except CMD is optional.  Values that contain spaces
    must be quoted.  The given command will be called with the given
    arguments, and the first line of output up to 80 characters read via
    an AmigaOS pipe and used as the value of the given variable.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> Optional user defined headers are now looked up in the
    variable list.  Coupled with the above feature, this allows one to use
    a user defined program to generate header values.  For example, you
    might have a program that prints the phase of the moon.  It's output
    can now be used to generate a NewsRog header.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> If the first word of a subject contained an encoded word
    according to RFC2047, the ISO encoding of the word would start on the
    2nd letter instead of the first.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> If the first character of the first word of a subject string
    was an encoded word according to RFC2047, then the word would not be
    encoded.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The Server Group's window has a new feature which allows
    a newsgroup to be browsed on a temporary basis without subscribing to
    the group.  This can be useful in order to read a few articles in a
    group you are not interested in on a long term basis.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A popup menu is available for URLs and email addresses.
    The menu allows the URL or email address to be copied to the
    clipboard, or for any associated multimedia action defined in NewsRog
    to be executed.  For example, if you have two web browsers, you can
    define two actions for the <B>application/X-URL</B> type, one called
    <B>Send-IBrowse</B> and another called <B>Send-AWeb</B>.  The popup menu for
    URLs will then list both choices.  The popup menus may be turned off
    in the display filter preferences.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The overhead of the HLPatt buffer has been reduced when it
    doesn't match anything in the article.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new Substitute display filter can substitute user
    defined strings or small graphic images for patterns in the displayed
    article.  You might use this to, for example, fix a few particularly
    common and annoying spelling errors, or to replace an ASCII smiley :-)
    with an actual graphic smiley.  Like other NewsRog display filters,
    the substitute filter only affects the presentation of the article,
    and does not change the original in any way.<P>

    There are a few predefined face images and an associated mask bitmap
    included with NewsRog in the Images/Faces directory.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The popup editor boxes in the group window now have an
    edit button which will show the editor for the active filter.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The rewrap filter will now put lines with no alphabetic
    characters on a line by themselves.  Such lines are most often strings
    of dashes ("--------") or other items which should not be rewrapped.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The BadWrap detector will no longer trigger if the line after
    the badly wrapped line matches the break pattern defined in the Rewrap
    filter.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>When adding new fitlers, the popup filter list now
    supports multiselection, so multiple filters can be added at once.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>New display filters are now added in an enabled state, so they
    do not need to be separately enabled.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The Paste menu in the post text editor was not functioning
    and has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The filter lists now have popup context menus which allow
    selected filters to be saved or loaded from disk, along with a few
    other operations.  Multiple filters can be saved to a file by
    multi-selecting the filters and selecting the save menu.  This allows
    you to easily save filters for future use, or to share your filters
    with other people.  Loading filters from a file will bring up a list
    of filters from that file (along with author notes if any), which can
    then be selected for loading. The Filter tutorial (Tutorial #12)
    contains more information on this topic.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Filters now have an optional Author Note which can be
    edited to provide a longer description of the filter.  This is useful
    when saving filters for sharing with other people.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The NewsRog command line now has new options to fetch
    articles and other information from a news server, and send the
    results to standard output.  For example, to fetch an article by
    Message-ID from a server named "my.news.com":<P>

      <UL>NewsRog SRV my.news.com MSGID "&lt;some.message@id&gt;"</UL><P>

    There are a number of other options for fetching other data from the
    server.  If the SRV parameter is omitted, the value of the NNTPSERVER
    environment variable is used to find the server to connect to.<P>

    Other command line batch operations are described in the reference
    section of the NewsRog documentation.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>All selection filters now have an option to control their
    behavior when used to limit the set of articles shown in the article
    list.  The setting, called Thread Mode, only affects the behavior of
    the filter when the article list is set to show thread entry points
    only.  In this case, there are several modes to pick from:<P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>Base - </B>A thread is shown only if the basenote of the thread
             matches the filter.  This was the behavior of earlier
             verions of NewsRog.<P></LI>

        <LI><B>Any - </B>A thread is shown if any article in the thread matches the
             filter.<P></LI>

        <LI><B>All - </B>A thread is shown only if all articles in the thread matche
             the filter.</LI>
       </UL><P>

     Using this setting allows an easy way to create, for example, a
     filter which shows new articles, and shows threads which contain any
     new articles if the article list is in Threads mode.  This setting
     does not affect other uses such as kill or highlight filters.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If a single article was marked, the article list display was
    not being updated to reflect the new state.</TD></TR>
       
  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The MatchHeader and MatchHeaderBase filters did not work with
    a few of the other types of filters, notably the "Marked" filter and
    others which checked article flags.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There are new command line options to avoid displaying
    the startup banner.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new set of group menus available for 
    copying certain parts of the displayed article,such as 
    the subject line, message-id, or even the entire article, to the
    clipboard.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There are some new group menus available for displaying
    the "raw" viewer article - that is, without using any display filters.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A kill filter bug introduced in version 1.4 is fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The uudecode filter now handles 4-octal-digit file modes as
    well as 3.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The line count displayed by the MIME plugin was always zero.
    It is now displayed properly.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new option in the uudecode and MIME plugins to
    display the width, height, and depth of images in the information
    block.  This is turned on by default.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new group option which allows incremental
    loading of articles to be turned off.  This is handy in binaries
    newsgroups to prevent needless re-parsing of uuencoded data.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>If an article is canceled part way through a download,
    leaving only a partial article in the local memory cache, then the
    entire article is re-read from the network next time the article is
    fetched, rather than the incomplete article being read from the memory
    cache.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If a network error occurred during a batch download
    operation, NewsRog would crash after the error requestor was canceled.
    This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a "Reset Article Pos" menu in groups which
    resets the last article position.  Normally, when entering a group,
    NewsRog reads only the new headers since the last time the group
    headers were fetched.  Using this menu option will reset the last
    article position, causing all the headers to be re-read the next time
    a header fetch happens.  Typically this is not needed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>After kill articles in a group reader window, the article

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Pressing the "Mark as Read" or "Mark as Unread" buttons from
    the group list window will now cause the article list to be updated if
    the group window for the selected group is open.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Batch downloads from the group list window were ignoring
    global kill filters.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The prefix 'Re: ' is now removed before comparing subject
    strings in the header match filter.  It was previously not, meaning
    that kill entries by subject created using the "Skull" icon in the
    group reader window were not processed correctly.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The local timezone adjustment could produce article
    datestamps in excess of 24:00 hours.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The memory allocation scheme for news articles has been
    changed to allow for increased performance when expiring or deleting
    articles (or article headers) from memory.  In some cases, this now happens up to 10 times as fast.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The Post Editor now has an "Insert Quoted" menu item
    which will add a text file as quoted text.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>In addition to icons for open, closed, and broken
    groups, there is a new group icon in the group list window which is
    displayed after a batch download operation on a given group.  The icon
    is reset when a group is read.  This way, it is easy to see which
    groups have batch downloaded articles since the last time the group
    was read.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The server group's list has an option to view the
    groups newly created since the last time this option was used.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A memory corruption problem when sending posts to the network
    has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If the font of some text in a scrollable quote block was set
    to italic, bold, or underlined, the height of the block would be
    miscalculated in previous versions.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The method of fetching headers has been changed to work better
    with some idiosyncratic news servers.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Many news servers do not automatically supply a Bytes:
    header, in which case NewsRog cannot display the size of the article
    in Kb.  There is a new option in the Config area which instructs
    NewsRog to ask for this header explicitly.  On the other hand, some
    news servers have performance problems when doing this and header
    downloads will become slower.  In this case, NewsRog can be instructed
    not to ask for the Bytes: header.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>If an article is aborted in the middle of a transfer, it is
    now marked with the "Broken" icon.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Kill filters that were run against new articles read from the
    network were being processed correctly, but kill filters run against
    articles read from the local disk cache could cause enforcer hits in
    some situations.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>When batch downloading articles, the article fetched
    immediately after a "broken" article (one which was not available on
    the server) would have an extra line inserted into the article body
    with a raw NNTP return code from the server.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The count of subscribed groups in the group list window
    ("Subscribed Groups (nn)") was remaining at zero when the group list
    window was first opened.  It now displays the count of subscribed
    groups.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The throughput when reading from a very fast networked source
    has been improved.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new DblSpace filter matches articles who's subject
    lines have d&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;b&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;s&nbsp;p&nbsp;a&nbsp;c&nbsp;e&nbsp;d letters.  Such articles are
    most often spam.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The default set of characters for the RepeatChar filter now
    includes a dollar sign ($).</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The NOSAVE and FORCE options to the CLOSEGROUP ARexx command
    were not functioning properly in previous versions and have been
    fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The "Bad Wrap" detector in the rewrap display filter would
    sometimes trigger on an empty middle line.  This no longer happens.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If the last line of a post composed in the post editor did
    not end with a newline, it would be skipped when the post was sent to
    the network.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD> The NoFlow pattern in the Rewrap display filter was being
    used as an anchored pattern, which means that it had to match the
    entire line.  This has been changed so that it need only match a
    prefix of the line.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The post line wrapping feature may be disabled via a
    configuration option in the main config window.  If so disabled, line
    breaks must be inserted via some other means, such as the built in
    editor or by using an external editor.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>NewsRog now issues a warning if a post is sent with lines
    over 80 characters.  Many people still read usenet using Unix
    text-based newsreaders such as "tin" which perform no line wrapping,
    and it is considered bad netiquette to post with longer lines.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>NewsRog now issues a warning if a post is sent with more
    quoted text than original text, for posts over a few lines.  It is
    considered bad netiquette to leave unnecessarily large blocks of
    quoted text in a reply.  The post may still be sent, but there is no
    way to avoid the warning.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The signature separator line added between a post and the
    signature file may now be omitted if it is part of the signature file
    itself.  A new option in the main configuration window controls this
    behavior.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>When moving from "One Thread" mode to "All Threads" mode, when
    all articles in the thread have been read and only read articles are
    being displayed, the list cursor now better tracks the position of the
    next thread.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The kill button (skull and crossbones icon) in the group
    window can now create global kill entries as well as group-local
    entries.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>When a batch download is in progress and other group windows
    are open, the article list no longer refreshes during the batch
    download unless some of the downloaded articles are crossposted to the
    open group.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Non-ASCII From: and Subject: header lines are now posted
    in RFC2047 format.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>RFC2047 format header lines are decoded into non-ASCII
    data when they are read from the network.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The badwrap detector in the Rewrap filter now detects a
    few additional cases, such bad line wrapping after a paragraph who's
    first line is indented.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A bug in the HLQuotes filter could cause quoted regions with
    most of the lines exceeding the max quote level to be displayed in
    their entirety instead of being trimmed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TH></TH><TH>Changes for NewsRog 1.3</TH></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A potential stack corruption problem in one of the NewsRog
    libraries that could cause crashes in some situations has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A memory corruption problem when closing group windows has
    been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>NNTP authentication is now supported via the "AUTHINFO
    user" and "AUTHINFO pass" commands.  Kerberos or other types of
    authentication are not currently supported.  User and password
    information for authentication is defined per server in the server
    list window.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The maximum string length for headers has been expanded.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The height of scrollable text blocks is now calculated more
    accurately when there are different fonts used within the block.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Double clicking on groups in the Server Groups window
    will now subscribe to the clicked-on group.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The group pattern string gadget in the Server Group's
    window is now active by default when the window is opened.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A FAQ management system has been added which can
    automatically fetch newsgroup FAQs from a FAQ server and display them.
    FAQs have a predefined multimedia type of "application/X-FAQ".
    Multimedia actions on FAQs may use the variable "FAQFile", which is
    set to the filename of the selected FAQ.  If no multimedia actions are
    defined for FAQs, the default is to view them using "multiview".  To
    define two additional actions for FAQs, one to save the FAQ to RAM:,
    and the other view it using a custom viewer, one might do this:<P>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The MIME display filter could crash if Display Inline was
    turned off and a non-zero value was on the stack.  This has been
    fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The busy pointer is no longer displayed during article display,
    unless the article contains an inlined image.  This means that
    keystrokes pressed during article decoding are no longer lost.  This
    means that it is now more pleasant to start an article downloading
    into the article viewer, and then page around in the article list
    while it is transferring.  Keystrokes are not lost when the article
    viewer updates progressively during the transfer.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Fixed a possible buffer overflow error in articles with very
    long subject strings.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new highlight filter feature can be used to highlight
    articles in the article list which match a particular selection
    filter.  This might be used, for example, to highlight articles by
    interesting authors.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>When articles were killed, they were not being uncached.
    They now are.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The post editor has a new mode which will show the
    complete post including the headers and signature file.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If a group defined a custom server, and a post was created in
    that group, the default server was still used to send the post,
    instead of the group's custom server.  The group's server is now used
    to send the post.  This only happens if you create the post from
    inside of a group.  If the post is created directly in the post list
    window, then the project's default server is used.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The Server Group's window would previously not load a saved
    group file if any group name was longer than 255 characters.  This
    limit has been increased to 1024 to accomodate very long newsgroup
    names.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The TextStyles display filter now has an option to
    constrain emphasized regions to start and end at word boundaries.
    This helps to avoid false positives when, for example, forward slashes
    are used in pathnames.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The "AutoClip" configuration option can be selected in
    order to have text that's selected in an article view be copied to the
    system clipboard as soon as it is selected.  If unselected, the
    clipboard behavior is identical to previous versions of NewsRog.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Replying to posts with very long Newsgroups: or Subject:
    headers would cause a crash 100% of the time.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If two articles in a group had the same message ID, NewsRog
    would corrupt the free memory pool.  This should *never* happen since
    message ID's are supposed to be unique, but in any case, the bug has
    been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>NewsRog no longer uses the NNTP XHDR command to fetch message
    IDs from the server when downloading the group overview information.
    It seems that some NNTP servers are very slow in replying to the XHDR
    command over a large range of articles, so an alternate method is now
    employed that may be faster on some news servers.  There are two
    drawbacks to the new method: First, when switching to a new NNTP
    server, NewsRog cannot be as intelligent about skipping article
    headers that are already present in the local news database.  Second,
    more data must be transferred over the modem when fetching the group's
    headers (although this may be offset by the higher transfer speeds for
    servers which don't do XHDR quickly).</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>NewsRog would get confused threading information for some
    types of NNTP servers.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>NewsRog now employs an alternate method of keeping the article
    list in sync with changes to articles that results in improved
    performance when switching between different article list modes.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>A new method of batch downloading articles is now employed
    which is better at maintaining a streaming data flow.  This can result
    in vastly improved batch download times.  Streaming batch downloads
    are only supported by using the "Batch D/L Articles..." button in the
    group list window.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The batch download status windows now display some other
    information, including the elapsed time (ET) for the transfer so far,
    the estimated time remaining, and the average number of headers or
    articles per second transferred so far.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A Batch D/L filter is now available in the Group List
    window.  This filter controls, on a group by group basis, which
    articles will be batch downloaded.  Thus, it is now possible to batch
    download only new articles, or only those less than a certain size,
    and so on.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Both batch D/L buttons in the Group List window (for headers,
    and for headers+articles) are now disabled when either is in progress,
    since these operations cannot take place simultaneously.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>If a batch D/L function was in progress, and another group
    window was closed, NewsRog would enter an infinite loop and lock up.
    This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Certain images that could not be decoded by the datatypes
    library would produce a (harmless) enforcer hit in NewsRog.  This has
    been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The prefetch count in the group preferences was off by one
    and has been fixed. If set to 2, it would only prefetch one article,
    and if set to 1, it would not prefetch any.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>An ARexx port has been added, with approximately 85
    commands.  More will be added in future versions.  A new chapter in
    the References section of the manual describes the ARexx commands.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The global "Any/All" mode of many of the filter lists was
    being ignored in many situations.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The post editor now offers improved rewrapping which is
    more intelligent about quoted text.  There is also a new menu option
    to explicitly rewrap the editor text instead of having it done when
    the text is posted to the network..</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The "Bad Wrap" detection in the Rewrap filter has been
    improved to detect some additional cases.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The EMail filter had a bug which could, in rare
    circumstances, cause messages to be truncated.  This typically
    happened only when parsing binary data, such as when trying to display
    uuencoded or MIME data without the associated filters turned on.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The EMail filter now has an option to require dots (.) in
    email address hostnames.  For example, "user@myhost.com" would be
    matched, but not "user@myhost".  This can prevent false positives when
    parsing certain types of data.</TD></TR>

process.<P>

<TABLE NOFLOW CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>
  <TR><TH></TH><TH>Changes for NewsRog 1.2</TH></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Newly downloaded articles can now be marked with an icon
    in the article list.  The new icon can be reset when the group is
    closed, or when articles are read, or both.  The feature can also be
    disabled on a per-group basis from the group preferences.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new selection filter can be used to match new articles.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Previously, tabs in articles were always being expanded to 8
    spaces.  Now, they are expanded only to the next position which is a
    multiple of 8 characters.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Global kill filters were not being processed properly.  They
    now are.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The relative weight of the size of the article list in
    the group window can now be set via the "Article List Weight" setting
    in the main preferences.  For example, if you want the ratio of
    article list to article view heights to be 40:60, you can set this
    number to "40".  This setting is found in the
    "Program Options/Misc Options" area of the config window.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Both the MIME &amp; UUDecode display filters now have an
    option to create directories when the "Save" button is pressed if
    those directories don't already exist.  This does not affect the "Save
    As" button, which still uses the file requestor.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Both the MIME &amp; UUDecode display filters now have an
    option to disable the "OK" and "Cancel" requesters that are normally
    displayed after a file is saved.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Groups now have a new variable called GroupNameChr.  It
    can supply the group name with "." characters transformed to an
    alternate character, which defaults to "/".  Use it like this:<P>
    <TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
      <TR><TH>Varible</TH><TH>Group Name</TH><TH>Expands To</TH></TR>
      <TR><TD>${GroupNameChr}</TD><TD>alt.foo.bar</TD><TD>alt/foo/bar</TD></TR>
      <TR><TD>${GroupNameChr,/}</TD><TD>alt.foo.bar</TD><TD>alt/foo/bar</TD></TR>

      <TR><TD>${GroupNameChr,#}</TD><TD>alt.foo.bar</TD><TD>alt#foo#bar</TD></TR>
    </TABLE><BR><P>

    This can be used inside the "Save Dir" field of MIME &amp; uudecode
    filters to automatically save data to pathnames built from the group
    name.  For example, you might use "DH0:Whatever/${GroupNameChr}".</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>the MUI help for the variable list in the config window was
    missing.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new Headers area in the global config window
    where optional headers such as X-No-Archive may be defined for a group
    or a specific set of groups such as "comp.sys.*".  A "Custom Headers"
    checkbox in the post editor controls whether custom headers are posted
    or ommitted.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new AgeRange selection filter can select articles based
    on their age in days.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new available column for article lists that
    shows the articles age in days, hours, and minutes.  The displayed age
    is the article's age when the group was opened, and is not updated
    continuously.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Fixed a number of typos in the documentation.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>previously, draging a subset of the filters from one filter
    list to another would cause them *all* to get copied.  Now, only the
    ones that got dragged are actually copied.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The size of articles in Kb/Mb can now be displayed in the
    article list.  This only works for newly downloaded articles.
    Articles that were fetched before version 1.2 will display a question
    mark for this field.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A SizeRange filter is available to select articles by
    size.  You might, for example, filter articles over 50 Kb.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new article list sort option for sorting by
    article size.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The group's defined sort order is now saved with the project
    and will be restored when the group is re-entered.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The group's column settings in the article list are now saved
    with the project and will be restored when the group is re-entered.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Hiding the toolbar window and showing it again no longer
    causes a duplicate set of icon images to be displayed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Hiding the last open main window now causes NewsRog to
    iconify itself.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>Running NewsRog a second time no longer creates another
    application.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Articles which have been killed are now also added to the
    read article count, so that a group's unread article count will be
    zero when all articles have been either read or killed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Previously, using the "Use Full Headers" option in groups
    would cause enforcer hits if the cursor was moved off of an article's
    entry in the artice list *after* NewsRog started fetching the article
    from the network, but *before* any lines arrived up from the server.
    This no longer happens.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The main windows now have a "Quit (No Save)" menu option
    that will quit without saving the group project (even if the exit mode
    is set to save projects on exit).  It is best to use this only when
    absolutely needed, since the group contains state information that is
    needed for optimal operation of the program.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The explicit expire menu option in the group window wouldn't
    function correctly if the first article number reported by the NNTP
    GROUP command was not preset on the server.  An alternate method of
    determining the age of the oldest article in the group is now used
    which does not have this problem and it should now work on a wider
    range of servers.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Previously, the group status line would display:
    "D/L'ing Articles (1 of 1)..."  and not return to display "Idle" after
    displaying an article that was fetched from disk or memory cache
    instead of from the network.  This has been fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Fixed a problem that was causing rare but occasional crashes
    either when exiting groups or when shutting down the program.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>Windows-Demangler.  Some broken MS-Windows applications
    put Windows backslash-style path components in uuencoded or MIME
    filenames.  A new feature detects these names and will ask you whether
    to translate them to a simple basename before saving.  This will avoid
    the "Please insert volume E:" requestors and backslashes as part of
    filenames.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The "Set Default" button in the server list window was not
    working.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Fixed a crash that could occur under rare conditions in the
    post editor if zero sized files were saved and re-edited, and the
    stack frame contained a particular value.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The insert feature of the builtin editor now inserts the text
    at the cursor location instead of replacing the old buffer text with
    the new.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>A single header split among multiple lines no longer cause
    NewsRog to treat this as the end of the header region.  However, to
    properly cope with articles with a header split onto multiple lines,
    the "Use Full Headers" option must be turned on.  This should fix the
    problem of the MIME Content-Type: header's "boundary" parameter being
    on a separate line from the Content-Type: header itself.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There are new buttons and hotkeys for moving
    forward/backward by threads/articles in the group reader window.  All
    common browing actions (scrolling in an article, moving to the
    next/previous article or next/previous thread) can now be performed
    using only the numeric keypad.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>In order to accommodate using the numeric keypad '+' and '-'
    keys for moving forward and backward by articles, the hotkey for the
    article list column editor has been changed to '^'</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>Image Bitmaps such as used in the main toolbar window and the
    post editor are now cached in memory.  This improves the performance
    when the window containing them is hidden and then shown again (in the
    post editor, for example).</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There are several new article list search options.  The
    list of headers to search through now includes new entries:<P>

      <TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
        <TR><TD><B>All Headers</B></TD>
            <TD>Searches through all article headers.</TD></TR>
        <TR><TD><B>Cached Bodies</B></TD>
            <TD> Searches through the bodies of all articles
                 that are currently displayed in the article
                 list and have cached bodies.</TD></TR>
        <TR><TD><B>Hdrs+Cached Bodies</B></TD>
            <TD>Searches through the headers + bodies of
                cached articles displayed in the article list.</TD></TR>
      </TABLE><BR><P>

    All of the above modes work with dynamic seaches, although a fast
    machine and disk subsystem is necessary for reasonable performance of
    dynamic searching though a large number of article bodies fetched from
    disk.  Having a sizeable disk cache helps as well, but on a fast
    machine, performance is quite reasonable.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>When searching in article bodies, if the search text is
    found inside of a scrollable quotation block, the block will be
    scrolled down to show the search text.  This only works with
    scrollable quote blocks, not toggled blocks.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Typing too fast for dynamic searches to keep up would
    sometimes cause the search to miss seeing valid matches.  This no
    longer happens.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Deleting characters from the middle of the string when doing
    dynamic searches now works better.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>Deleting all the characters from the string gadget in search
    windows now causes the next search to restart from the beginning, even
    if the search start position was initially later.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The article list in the group window can be restricted to
    viewing just a selected set of articles with the new menu option
    "Limit to Selected".  This, in combination with the search features,
    provides an easy way to, for example, batch download all articles
    containing some string in the subject line.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>The rewrap filter would occasionally remove blank lines that
    should have been left in to separate paragraphs.  It is a bit more
    intelligent about this now.  Although doing perfect rewrap in the
    absense is markup information is not possible, the filter performs
    better now.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The HideSig filter has an option for specifying the
    maximum length of a signature block.  This helps to prevent hiding of
    text when authors use signature style separator lines to separate
    quoted from new text.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD> The article font and color can now be specified per
    group, in the group window's config area.  If turned off, the values
    from the main config window are inherited.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug Fix</B></TD><TD>Going to offline mode now closes bsdsocket.library.  This
    should prevent TCP stacks from sending quit signals to NewsRog if they
    exit while NewsRog is still running, as long as NewsRog is in offline
    mode.  In online mode, of course the networking library must be open,
    so exiting the TCP stack will send a quit signal to NewsRog. </TD></TR>

<TABLE NOFLOW CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>
  <TR><TH></TH><TH>Changes for NewsRog 1.1a</TH></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug fix</B></TD><TD>Articles with a From: field containing an open paren but no
    closing paren, such as:<BR><UL>
        Joe Cool (<BR></UL>
    would cause NewsRog to crash when displaying the article.  Fixed.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug fix</B></TD><TD>The multimedia actions list was not preserving the stack size
    and priority set for various commands.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug fix</B></TD><TD>If the NNTP server reset its message IDs, NewsRog would
    sometimes fail to read new messages.  This situation is now detected.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug fix</B></TD><TD>If, due to a corrupted database on the NNTP server, XHDR
    returned a null Msg-ID for an otherwise valid article, NewsRog would
    crash.  This has been fixed.  However, this situation should never
    occur and is a data corruption problem on the news server.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Bug fix</B></TD><TD>If a global display filter was added with a group pattern,
    the filter would properly appear or not appear in the global filter
    list of individual groups.  But when an article was displayed, all
    filters would be used anyway.  Patterns in global display filters work
    properly now.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is now a button in the group list to toggle between
    Online and Offline mode.  It performs the same function as the menu
    items.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is now a built in text editor for composing posts.
    External editors may still be used as well.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There are some new options in the global config area to
    control line wrapping for posts.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is a new option to turn off NewsRog generated
    message IDs.  In this case, the news server must generate the message
    ID.  It is usually best to let NewsRog generate Message IDs, but in
    some firewall configurations the news server must do it.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The bold, italic, and underline styles in the TextStyle
    display filter can now be turned on and off independently.  In many
    cases, for example, it might be desirable to turn off the italic style
    to avoid making slashes/used/to/separate/alternatives or path/names/
    into italic text.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>When toggling on hidden text (such as a hidden signature
    block), the region is now scrolled into the visible display area if it
    was partially out of view.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The numeric pad enter key can now be used as a synonym
    for the return key.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>The NewsRog toolbar style can now be set to horizontal or
    vertical, with or without labels.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>A new HLPatt filter can highlight user defined patterns
    in article bodies.  You might, for example, highlight your cat's name
    when reading posts in the rec.pets.cats.* hierarchy.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>New Feature</B></TD><TD>There is now a "Select All" button in the post list
    window.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The ramiga-c hotkey no longer closes the group reader window.
    Instead, it copies any currently selected text to the clipboard, which
    is a more standard meaning for this key.</TD></TR>

  <TR><TD VALIGN=Top><B>Change</B></TD><TD>The browse mode in the group reader now will load the
    article highlighted in the article list instead of the next article,
    if no article is currently displayed in the article view.</TD></TR>
